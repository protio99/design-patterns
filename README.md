# Welcome 👋  

Hi there! This repository is a collection of information about design patterns. I don't intend to present this as if I were an expert—I'm actually learning about the topic. I just wanted to share the examples I’ve made to study and understand this awesome subject better.  

Everything you'll find here is based on two sources:  

1. An amazing website with a lot of helpful information about design patterns: **[Refactoring Guru](https://refactoring.guru/design-patterns)**.  
   I highly recommend checking it out—it has many examples, diagrams, and fun illustrations that make learning much more enjoyable.  
   
2. A **design patterns course on Platzi/Design patterns course in Js**, taught by **[Daniel Basulto]**.  
   This excellent course helped me strengthen my understanding of design patterns. I took all the examples from this course.
